# Platformer Procedural Generation
 Unity 2D Sidescroller Procedurally Generated Levels

The project has a lot of scripts that are works in progresses included - however not used in any commited scenes.
The main goal is somewhat achieved - with room for improvement. 

Using the application:

1. If the experimental generation shouldn't be included leave the input field at 0 and press Play.
 
   1a. Should the experimental feature be used a higher input integer leads to more "empty" squares. 
     That said it could lead to the player getting stuck so I would recommend not using it for now.


2. Controls:
  
   2a. The player controls:
       
       Left and right use the arrow keys, jump with the up arrow key (double jumping is enabled).
 
   2b. The scene controls (only applicable on the generated level i.e. post Play button scene):
      
       Escape: Returns to the landing scene.
      
       Return(Enter): Generate a new level.
      
       Space: Swaps between a player view camera and an overview camera.
